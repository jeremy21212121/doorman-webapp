# Doorman - Home Automation Web App

This is a web app that allows me to trigger embedded devices that control my door locks.

To see the code for the embedded devices, which are based on the esp8266 SoC, see my other doorman-* repos:

* [repo for main door buzzer code](https://github.com/jeremy21212121/doorman-webapp)

* [repo for stepper-motor-powered door-knob-unlocker](https://github.com/jeremy21212121/doorman-apartment-arduino)
